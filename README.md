## Caeser Cipher APP (CCA) Introduction
### 1. What is Caeser Cipher
The caeser Cipher is an alpabhet shifting technique where each lette of plaintext is shifted a number entered of times down the alphabet. 
This rotational techque was invented and first implemented by Gaius Julius Caesar. 

### 2. What is Caesar-Cipher-App (CCA)
Caesar-Cipher-App (CCA) is a web application that allow users to apply caeser cipher technique via the terminal. 

### 3. How Caesar-Cipher-App (CCA) Works
 Caesar Cipher technique achieves plaitextshifting using two methods namely encoding and decoding. 
 The user is asked to enter any letters of alphabet without a space then click enter. 
 Afterthat, the App will ask the user to enter an interger number by which they want the letters shifted. 
 The app will then display the encoded and decoded strings.
